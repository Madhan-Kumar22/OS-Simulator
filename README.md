# OS-Simulator

Operating System (OS) is like the heart of a computer. Even though all the hardware is available, there is no use of a computer without an OS. Therefore learning about the components and concepts of the Operating system is very much essential and useful. We have built this simulator to test our understanding of concepts and various algorithms in OS.
